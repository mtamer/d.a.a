# d.a.a = Data Article Analysis
Data Analyzing 

The whole point of this script is to to analyze the most frequently used words in the past # of articles being crawled in relation to what we enter for our search. I built this script because I had a huge interest in the stock market and wanted to know what words came up more frequently then others. We can see that nowadays everything online, every article written, everything said about a certain company being true or false can have a positive or a negative affect on that company. This in turn can affect the stock price of the company in bad or good way. 

#### To Run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python frequentAnalysis.py

```
**Note that not all requirements are needed for this script. View Script for more details.
